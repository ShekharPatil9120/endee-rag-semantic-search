0,Corn___Common_Rust,Sandy/Loam,"Use Neem Oil (3%) spray + Potassium Bicarbonate on leaves. Choose resistant varieties.","Apply Propiconazole (1.0 ml/L) or Azoxystrobin. Spray only if more than 10% of the leaf area is infected."
1,Corn___Gray_Leaf_Spot,Sandy/Loam,"Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least two years. Plow down infected residue.","Apply a Strobilurin fungicide (e.g., Azoxystrobin or Pyraclostrobin) followed by a Triazole (e.g., Propiconazole) for rotation."
2,Corn___Healthy,N/A,"Maintain optimal soil fertility and pH; ensure proper drainage.","N/A (Focus on preventive scouting and agronomic best practices)."
3,Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight,Sandy/Loam,"Use resistant hybrids and ensure tillage to bury crop residue where the pathogen overwinters.","Apply a Triazole (Tebuconazole) or Strobilurin (Azoxystrobin). Rotate between these groups for resistance management."
4,Invalid,N/A,"N/A","N/A"
5,Potato___Early_Blight,Sandy Loam,"Apply Compost Tea weekly and maintain optimum soil moisture. Do not over-fertilize with nitrogen.","Rotate a Protectant (Chlorothalonil 2.5g/L or Mancozeb) with a systemic fungicide (e.g., Difenoconazole or Azoxystrobin)."
6,Potato___Healthy,N/A,"Plant certified, disease-free seed. Maintain soil organic matter (loamy soil).","N/A (Focus on preventive hilling and sanitation)."
7,Potato___Late_Blight,Loamy,"Build tall, firm hills to cover tubers. Spray Milk Solution (1 part milk: 2 parts water) weekly.","Rotate Protectant (Mancozeb 2.0g/L) with a systemic fungicide (e.g., Mandipropamid or Propamocarb) on a 5–7 day schedule during high-risk periods."
8,Rice___Brown_Spot,Clay,"Control weeds that act as hosts. Spray Fermented Rice Water or Buttermilk (natural antifungal).","Apply Tricyclazole (0.6 g/L) or a mix of Propiconazole + Difenoconazole for severe cases."
9,Rice___Healthy,N/A,"Ensure proper water management and balanced NPK fertilization.","N/A (Focus on weed control and using healthy seed)."
10,Rice___Leaf_Blast,Clay/Loam,"Avoid excessive Nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Use resistant varieties.","Apply Tricyclazole or Isoprothiolane at the tillering stage. For rotation, use Azoxystrobin or Carbendazim."
11,Rice___Neck_Blast,Clay/Loam,"Maintain optimum water level and avoid late-season Nitrogen application.","Apply a second spray of Tricyclazole or Carbendazim just before the panicle emergence (booting stage)."
12,Wheat___Brown_Rust,Loam,"Choose rust-resistant varieties. Ensure proper spacing for good air circulation.","Apply Propiconazole or Tebuconazole at the first sign of infection (flag leaf stage is critical)."
13,Wheat___Healthy,N/A,"Ensure seed treatment before planting. Maintain crop residue for soil health.","N/A (Focus on timely sowing and good seed bed preparation)."
14,Wheat___Yellow_Rust,Loam,"Use resistant cultivars that match the local race of the pathogen.","Apply a Triazole fungicide like Propiconazole or Tebuconazole. Early spraying is crucial as the disease spreads quickly in cool conditions."
